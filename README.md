# workflow
Familiarize ourselves with the git workflow
To familiarize ourselves with the feature workflow in git I have created a simple hello world file. 
I know this is overly simplistic, but the focus of this meeting is to really focus on getting comfortable
with the workflow and not so much the code. The simplicity of the code just ensures that we don't have to 
spend time on it and we can just dive into working on it as a team.
